# XYZ-Merchstore-Fullstack

This project served as my introduction to the MERN web development stack. Though crude, I managed to create a custom API and backend to propel a barebones catalogue and add-to-cart system.
Stored locally, the mongoDB database I created housed JSON format products including id, image, title and a "hearts" (like) system.
The front-end was streamlined using a mix of react and bootstrap.
